# iNaturalist API Tool for the Connect to Protect Network

This script was developed to research the impact of Fairchild Tropical Garden's "Connect To Protect Network", a program that encourages homeowners to plant species native to the pine rocklands of Miami-Dade County. 

It searches the iNaturalist API for sightings of pine rockland species within the Greater Miami area. The data is cleaned and saved to CSV.

This script was developed by CTPN member and volunteer David James Knight in consultation with Fairchild botanist Jennifer Posley.
